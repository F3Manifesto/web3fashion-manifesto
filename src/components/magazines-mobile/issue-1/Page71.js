      <h1>Andrea Nieto </h1>
     </a>
     <p>
      Andrea is a multidisciplinary designer and innovator originally from Colombia. Andrea’s background is in apparel and textile design but her work has expanded to include the areas of footwear design and digital experiences. Now Andrea leads from a design perspective projects across those different competencies at Adidas’s innovation team - Future. 
      <br/><br/>
      Andrea joined Adidas back in 2014 and since has been helping build the latest innovations for the brand.  Some of her most recent work is a new proprietary Adidas technology innovation called Strung. This new technology leverages robots to help build new types of textiles that are high resolution and allow the integration of athlete/human data into the workflow.
      <br/><br/>
      On her free  time Andrea explores digital design widely, all the way from non-practical artistic applications to more utilitarian ones like digital footwear and apparel. Andrea is passionate to build the next generation of functional NFT experiences for the Metaverse as well as to build bridges to the physical world in more sustainable ways.
