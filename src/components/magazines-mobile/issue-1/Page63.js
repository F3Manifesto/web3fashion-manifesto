        That's why the countless layers of digital realities humanity are relentlessly marching towards are just about to hit their stride as legitimate alternatives to the mundane post-pandemic society we have been forced into acquiescence with.
        <br/><br/>
        The coronavirus pandemic plunged the entire world into a prolonged and sustained economic recession literally overnight. That's what happens when half of the world's 7.9 billion souls are placed on lockdowns and stay-at-home directives. The creative sector was hit harder than expected, as diminishing opportunities and closures of cultural venues continue to take their toll on the economy. Billions in lost sponsorships, lack of performances, closed venues, and massive industry layoffs affected millions of creatives' livelihoods worldwide, fighting to survive COVID's unstoppable onslaught.

        And it doesn't end at economic depression because there's little doubt that the global health crisis worsened mental depression rates across the board. Based on a study published in the International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology, depression prevalence increased by over seven times during 2020. 
        <br/><br/>
        Clinical depression is defined as an overwhelming sense of inadequacy and a downcast lack of activity. McGonigal posits that playing video games can provide players an unbridled optimism about their own agency amidst an engaging flurry of action leading to tangible results, thus promoting a positive mindset that every single individual can use, gamer or otherwise. 
        <br/><br/>
        What McGonigal is saying is that if there was a way we can harness and apply the same mental focus, determination, grit, intensity of engagement, and resourcefulness to our real-world problems as we do when we try to complete a mission on Grand Theft Auto, not only would it evoke a positive mental attitude, but it would make us happier, more engaged and motivated to attain realistic personal and professional goals.

        Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita has always been used to determine a country's inhabitants' material wealth. But pandemic recovery isn't just a matter of hard and fast GDP numbers and black-and-white solutions. Bouncing back from the one of the biggest global health crisis also requires looking at specific aspects like job security, work-life balance, social connections, and safety, among many other factors that determine an individual's subjective well-being. True recovery also takes the latter into consideration because a more emotionally content populace leads to lower crime and higher standards of happiness.
