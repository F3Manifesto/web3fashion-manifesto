          Hey! I‚Äôm *redacted* the systems/persona administrator speaking on behalf of the Hvdson project - a decentralized headless brand (launch date tbd) ü§ñ‚ù§Ô∏èüéµ. 
          <br/><br/>
          Before i was a regular lame ass artist that was trying to follow the traditional music industry route, but that was lame af like hedge funds, so i decided to pivot to something that wasn‚Äôt so boomer and here we are with web3.
          <br/><br/>
          as for my music style, i‚Äôve been all over the place - picked up a bunch of instruments as a kid but didn‚Äôt have anyone to play with so i thought i‚Äôd just learn enough to record for a band, found electronic music and realized i could do all that in the computer,  stuff about the process that no one cares about cause they only want the result and event  COVID happened - quit music for a bit and went to work as a software engineer, crypto go up, and now here somehow üöÄ       
        </p>

          I first found out about Bitcoin back 2013, mined maybe about ~10 on my shitty laptop on the time and forgot about it for a while (the laptop was never recoverable). 
          <br/><br/>
          Then to 2017 a friend of mine mentioned that he was in this thing called Ethereum and i looked into it and aped in cause it sounded cool. 
          <br/><br/>
          Price went up, market crashed but held the belief that this could change the world, so i just hodled since i expected 0 or moon on it. Fast forward to the future, thanks to my past self for üíéüôå it went up and caught my attention again and now i‚Äôm in it for the long run. Went searching for a community that was forward and long-term thinking and found $FWB (friends with benefits) and through that community i found songcamp through another member matthew chaim - the one that started the idea of songcamp :)
          <br/><br/>
          Can you tell us more about your release with songcamp and the genesis batch collaboration? 
          <br/><br/>
          the camp itself and the tooling setup is the first of its kind from what i know - we‚Äôre sitting on the bleeding edge of protocols and tooling with a fee-less ‚Äòmusic lego‚Äô structure, which will allow all the parties to get paid in a trust-less way, granted that the fee structure was set up at the beginning. to me that‚Äôs amazing since having to wait to get paid for a service after invoicing someone is dumb.
        </p>
        <h2 className={styles.title3}>FIRST DROP. AUDIO NFTS.</h2>
        <p className={styles.text3}>
          it‚Äôs cool that it‚Äôs the first drop of it‚Äôs kind, but the real work has just begun. in this new internet that we‚Äôre building, no one knows wtf they‚Äôre doing - we‚Äôre all throwing paint at the wall and duct-taping stuff to get it working. but that being said, it‚Äôs so exciting for every artist in the space - for the first time we can get paid directly for our art. no middlemen, no bs, no having to compromise. we‚Äôre all building stuff together and i think that‚Äôs beautiful.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text4}>
          imo NFTs right now are just a cash grab and are a bubble - i‚Äôm hyped at the possibility of making money off of this directly. people are getting discouraged because they‚Äôre not making $69 million on their NFT that they posted. 
          <br/><br/>
          but to me i see this bubble as a necessary step to weed out the noise in the short run. the attention economy is dwindling and celebrities of a singular nature will be a thing of the past. 
          <br/><br/>
          they‚Äôre trying to grab as much cash as they can after their time is up. celebrities die. headless brands are forever. as for right now i am doing the same thing i have before since the tools are the same.
          <br/><br/>
          everything is so low fidelity right now and the best we can do is the equivalent of Ed Catmull trying to make a 2021 pixar film in the 1970s - we‚Äôre so early. all we have is jpgs and low effort octane renders. 
          <br/><br/>
          i‚Äôm excited to see what the future holds when technology advances and the tools develop to the state of where we are now in web2. 
          <br/><br/>
          Here‚Äôs a project i released back right as covid hit called ‚ÄúIn Security‚Äù<br/>

          audio nfts first swallowed matthew chaims, founder of songcamp, back in the fall of 2020. It was a ‚Äòlight on‚Äô moment where he realised just how much web3 and nfts can empower artists; especially those that aren‚Äôt cookie cutter and don‚Äôt fit as well into the current traditional music industry, whether that be because of the way that they work or the type of music that they make.
          <br/><br/>
          matt, through songcamp, ran the very first web3 music art collaboration with 9 different artists; it was a virtual song camp. using web3 tools to experiment and start Building a community that can act as an extremely valuable and accessible place for musicians to be able to fall down the same rabbit hole. because now, there just isn‚Äôt enough onboarding, supportive hand holding. songcamp is building frameworks to bring in more musicians and artists as a whole who don‚Äôt know what is going on; they just read these headlines about beeple and $69 million nft auctions, but they just don‚Äôt know what that even means. because, how can they be expected to?
          <br/><br/>
          matt knows that web3 and nfts will proliferate and eat their way into the entire music industry, bringing completely new avenues of value to artists. and, musicians really need that. even as an artist himself, matt has millions of streams on some top streaming platforms like spotify and still sees no tangible value from it. it‚Äôs opaque, it takes forever and you are just getting fractions of a penny. for so long this has felt like the only way. but now, it‚Äôs obvious that it‚Äôs not. there are other ways and we are just beginning to experiment with radical optimism of opportunity that these other ways support.
