    <h3>A Drunken Tailor’s Walk</h3>
    <h4><p>We live these truths to be self-evident, tempered into the fabric of our roots and woven within the frameworks of our souls. 
    <br></br><br></br>
When in the course of human interaction we lose the threads of our shared histories for a time, long and short, it becomes necessary to dispel the illusions of choice we have as civilisations, ancient and modern, found ourselves ensnared within.
    <br></br><br></br>
F​​rom each new generation, our freedom to defend and advance, to play a part in making these days memorable in the account of our moments.
    <br></br><br></br>
When I weave through this near never-ending city, all these threads of ours, this infinite inventory and memory machine of the most intimate and human frictions catch, gathering the part of the ledger they thought was gone and finished and liquidated. 
<br></br><br></br>
The insincere treatment of scattered fibres for a false peace offer. A long drag down a slippery slope with talk of negotiated conformity, only to remove all options, unable to turn back, an abandonment in the pursuit of corrupted theoretical economic and social philosophy. 
<br></br><br></br>
Seeking comfort in the system that has no care for you guarantees perpetual destruction of the world you’re promised. That’s the thing they never tell you about time decay, it’s the same risk either way, unfailing repeats of uncontrollable collapses.  
<br></br><br></br>
You might think you are going somewhere but you end up going nowhere. 
<br></br><br></br>
No! Are you out of your mind! 
<br></br><br></br>
Eliminate the necessity. Change the shape of the pattern. 
<br></br><br></br>
A sincerely designed revolution for overturning and destroying vulnerable static systems to liberate the old and boldly expand into new sources of robust primary fabrication. It’s the new narrative thread creating decentralised production capacity and capital so more is made from it than what we wear. 
<br></br><br></br>
If you’re not afraid of the previous odds, you shouldn’t be afraid of these new odds.
<br></br><br></br>
<strong>Because there is always demand for more thread. Always.</strong>
