        Journey Of A Modder

      <p className={styles.text1}>The modding community is the backbone to the gaming and esports industries. The modders have built the castles for the OG game content that so many of us identify with, supporting increasingly novel content for building avid player bases and die hard fans. The community is heavily undervalued, unseen. </p>
      <p className={styles.text2}>
        DARK PRINCE has been an integral part of the modding community for a number of years. He identified with mod culture after being introduced to the vibrant Devil May Cry modding scene. Since then, he has become one of the most inspiring, humble and well known voices in the DMC community. He mods because he has a true passion and wants to bring joy to others through his content.
        <br/><br/>
        When first meeting Dark Prince in the devilmaycry.org forum he was so welcoming— decoding the ins and outs of the ecosystem and openly sharing his journey as a modder. </p>
      <p className={styles.text3}>
      I can't remember exactly how long, but, I can guess that I was around 4 or 5 (God knows my memories). I played classic Sega games. Then back when I was around 6-7 or 8 (my memory is still foggy) I was playing interesting “brick” games before becoming a PC gamer from XP between 8 and 10 and yeah I was also a bit of a mobile gamer.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text4}>
      I love DMC (Vergil), Marvel stuff (Spider-Man & Venom) and Shadow of Mordor/War (Badass Elf Lord Celebrimbor). I would like to see Spider-Man again on PC.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text5}>
      From what I can remember I always played games without mods and I wasn’t even aware that there was a modding community out there! But, after installing DMC I suddenly became more curious in modding scene, and the rest was history... I started my hobby as a modder.  
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text6}>
        I'm not a “special person” or anything but when I came across the modding community I realised that this is a place where I can really let my imagination run wild. There truly are no limits. You inspire the narrative.
      <br/><br/>
      Spider-Man games finally have more suits! A version of a game can have exclusive content that isn’t originally provided to PC players! With mods, PC players can experience the same content as exclusive players of the same platform— Marvel Ultimate Alliance can be remastered with mods to the latest version. It’s pretty amazing.
