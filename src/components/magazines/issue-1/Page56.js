    <h2>Declaration of Patterns & First Principles</h2>
    <h3><p>Relying on cloth alone is a risky way to preserve patterns. It assumes that each new practitioner has a teacher to translate the embedded code into manual practice. How to create patterns remains insider knowledge. 
<br></br><br></br>
That’s why what Marx Ziegler did was so radical. A master weaver in the southern German town of Ulm, Ziegler was dismayed to see the city’s textile merchants turning to suppliers as far away as Holland to satisfy the demand for their famous linens. Ulm’s weavers, they complained, couldn’t keep up with seventeenth- century fashions for patterned tablecloths, bed hangings, and window curtains. 
<br></br><br></br>
“It is sometimes held”, Ziegler lamented, “that it would be impossible to make something like it in our own land, as though we were not blessed with as much intelligence as other people.” Yet, he himself had made all kinds of textiles, from fine linens to heavy rugs, and had mastered patterns requiring as many as thirty-two different shafts. Nor did he believe his neighbours lacked enterprise or talent. 
<br></br><br></br>
The problem, he concluded, was that ambitious Ulm weavers had little chance to learn how to recreate patterns, because those who had the know-how hoarded their expertise. “There are those who understand the art but are selfishly concerned that nothing should be revealed”, he observed. So, breaking with his profession’s traditional secrecy, Ziegler decided to write an instructional manual. In 1667 ‘Weber Kunst und Bild Buch’ or ‘The Weavers Art and Tie-Up Book’, became the first book of weaving patterns ever published. 
<br></br><br></br>
It took professional boldness for Ziegler to put his weaving know-how into print. It also required a written code: a way of translating the directions for woven patterns into easily decipherable diagrams. Just as musical scores record which notes to sound, Ziegler’s book used lines and graph paper to show weavers how to thread their looms and which shafts to raise to create specific patterns. His diagrams provided a layer of abstraction between material practice and pure mathematics. Today’s weaving drafts descend from its notation. 
<br></br><br></br>
Ziegler’s book expressed the period’s growing belief in sharing useful knowledge—the attitude that a century later would culminate in Diderot’s massive ‘Encyclopédie’, with its detailed, illustrated articles on mechanical arts, ranging from wig making to slate mining and including several types of weaving. “I hold that it would be possible to produce many more artists in all branches of knowledge”, Ziegler wrote, “if only there were no shortage of publishers.” He thus played a role in what economic historian Joel Mokyr has called the Industrial Enlightenment, as scientific theorists and practical craftsmen increasingly joined forces, informing one another’s understanding and making both kinds of knowledge more widely accessible.
<br></br><br></br>
Weavers have long used private notation to record patterns. Condemning the secrecy of his fellow craftsman, Ziegler wrote that “tie up books must be necessary for draw loom and treadle-loom weavers, since without them no one could learn to weave or accomplish anything of the sort.” But before his book, those diagrams were trade secrets. Only when its intermediary code became public, and therefore visible to non-weavers, could weaving inspire outsiders to learn from its examples or apply their ingenuity in its formerly closed domain. 
<br></br><br></br>
Ziegler's book and similar manuals, writes Harlizius-Klück, “made the art of weaving public, and its notation became standardized and common. With the notation close to the machine, they furthermore facilitated mutual understanding of the interaction between pattern drafting and loom parts for nonweavers and through this enabled engineers and inventors to play around with the mechanisms finally leading to an automated loom.”

<h4>Excerpt from “The Fabric of Civilization” by Virginia Postrel</h4>
<h5><p>With the rise and spread of ad targeted hyper networks of mass persuasion and misinformation, these new money, mad king, tech behemoth, monopolisers of capital, time and attention have re-enshrined the near ancient selfish secrecy of those who understand the art yet believe nothing should be revealed––condemning us all to the loss of know-how and destruction of all the wealth that could have been. 
<br></br><br></br>
The counterparty action starts with gathering the components that make primary production uncensorable. 
<br></br><br></br>
The first of these is entirely familiar to every generation born yesterday or a century ago. Relatively new yet quickly interwoven into every serious practice of society, economics, work and play, what we call social media is really a small collection of a few essential features across a handful of distinguishable channels. They each emphasise a distinct aspect of user content and interactions, with the most notable of them including video uploads & streaming of practically any length, topic or purpose, quick sometimes threaded bursts of micro posts that can be photos, text, images, polls or short videos, algorithmically fed to you short clips quickly edited, filtered and overlaid with music, and, IRC meets voiceover IP with a fresh coat of paint. The features they have in common are practically invisible to us all by now, from profile photos and user accounts to upvotes, downvotes, private messages, reposts, follows and blocks.
<br></br><br></br>
These are all fully understood, easily replicable mass scale responsive interfaces built on branded social graphs. 
<br></br><br></br>
These social graphs begin to deliver on what makes the free flow of endlessly original content and personal coordination between friends and strangers alike so damn powerful. They begin, but for the lack of personal sovereignty, quickly fail to prevent misinformation, polarization, and attacks against our ever more valuable private data from letting all users down hard.
<br></br><br></br>
It isn’t until community governance, shared ownership and dispute resolution are rooted in a manifest stake for each participant across all cultures and societies that social graphs actually deliver. 
<br></br><br></br>
The unexpected benefits that make graphs, owned and operated through decentralised social coordination, and enshrined item by item, choice by choice within instant cultural delivery mechanisms, which we have come to call NFTs, just hit different.
<br></br><br></br>
Independent from anyone who would normally try, given any chance, to cut you off from your rights to stake, strike, create, vote and govern, and freely associate with whoever you please,  there are a surprisingly small number of mechanisms that make DAOs, NFTs, and really anything in web3, work so much better than any of the previous attempts that have come before. They are at a minimum; the ability to mint, transfer, add a primary sale price, set a token URI, burn, stake and add a relationship. 
<br></br><br></br>
Systems collapse when the yield stress of the carrying capacity within an ecosystem is breached. These convex flares snap to produce market crashes and a perpetual generation of Halting errors. The only counter to disentangle this tug of war is through a factorial decentralisation of the capital stack, where diverse pools of capital supply are able to provide frictionless entry, strike, swap, and aggregate discovery to prevent outsized capital flow distortions and disincentives. 
<br></br><br></br>
How does real capital make itself available with the ability to move from the places where it gathers to places where it is useful in real time continuously, whilst actively preventing and incentivising against tyrannies of the minority, the majority and malicious actions generated by tugs of war between both extremes?</p></h5>
