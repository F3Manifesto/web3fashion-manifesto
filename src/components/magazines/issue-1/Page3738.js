      <h1>Freedom to Play</h1>
      <h3><p>Are we really in charge of our own fate? 
<br></br><br></br>
Not when the gear we carry, places we go, memories we share, money we make, and even the stories we tell about ourselves are all owned and controlled by someone else. 
<br></br><br></br>
From pay to win, pay to play, and free to play to freedom to play. 
<br></br><br></br>
What is sovereignty in a massive multiplayer metaverse enabled world? 
<br></br><br></br>
To create or unlock your pocket empire, the clear conditions for freedom to play are dynamically set within portals to other free realities, markets, economies.
<br></br><br></br>
Liberate ownership beyond the hands of the mediocre few. Mod your way to a more seriously playful and radically self determined future.</p></h3>
