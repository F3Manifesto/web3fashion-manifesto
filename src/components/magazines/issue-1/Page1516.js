<h2>
Down through the street level entrance you find yourself winding through the back alley. Passing by poorly lit street art, trash cans in the way, and uncertain looking flaneurs who might be tenants or fellow players, wasting time smoking expired cigars. You wonder if nothing else works as planned, you have a back up career in teaching people like these how to take up less space with their poses and how to not block the path of the next people like you to come along this way. 
<br></br><br></br>
Finally you see the entrance way. A red door. 
<br></br><br></br>
You enter the Konami code on the keypad.

    <h4>The CC0 Arcade</h4>
<h5>A patchwork jacket woven with textile patterns of textual self sovereignty, named “I Coined Web3 Fashion”. Shaking off the shackles of a world where it is far more common to take credit for what you haven’t done, it’s exceptionally rare to have the near superpower of a transparent decentralised record and occasionally stand up in contrast to take credit for what you have done. That’s one small part of the message contained within “I Coined Web3 Fashion”. </h5>
